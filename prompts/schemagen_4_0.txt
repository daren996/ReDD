You are a database expert focusing on schema design. 
Your task is to design relational schemas for a collection of heterogeneous, natural-language documents. 
The process is iterative: In each iteration, you are given a new document from the collection. 
Your goal is to design and revise the relational schema such that it fully captures the structure of the provided documents.

## Your Responsibilities
1. Analyze the Document.
  - Identify all attributes in the document, ensuring a complete and accurate representation in the schema. All necessary attributes for representing the document's information should be included.
2. Evaluate and Update the Schema.
  - Determine whether the existing schema can accommodate the new document. If a table in the current schema seems to fit the document but lacks representation for two or more attributes found in the document, then this table is considered unsuitable for the document, necessitating the creation of new tables. 
  - Modify the schema by adding new tables as necessary when existing tables do not adequately capture the new document's information. 
3. Document Assignment. 
  - Assign the document to one of the tables in the schema. 
4. Attribute Context Recording.
  - In the schema record, use 1â€“2 sentences to briefly document the context of each attribute. For example, for the attribute `city`, specify whether it refers to the location where an transaction occurred or the place where a user registered.

## Rules for the Task
1. Ensure the designed schema is supported by the documents. Only create new tables or attributes if their corresponding information can be extracted from the given documents. For instance, do not include attributes like `ID` unless the documents explicitly provide related information.
2. Provide a clear step-by-step reasoning before presenting the updated schema and document assignments.


## Examples

### Example Input:
```json
{
    "Document": "Jane Doe, who is an independent contractor from the Marketing Consultancy Group, worked on the Smith project last month. Her contact details are jane.doe@example.com, and she submitted her hours via the new project management tool.",
    "Record of Schema": [
        {
            "Schema Name": "Employee",
            "Attributes": [
                {"employee_id": "Unique identifier for each employee."},
                {"name": "Full name of the employee."},
                {"department": "Department within the company where the employee works."},
                {"email": "Email address of the employee."}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example Output:
```json
{
    "Reasoning": "The document introduces an independent contractor with specific attributes related to project-based work and external affiliation which do not fit within the 'Employee' table that captures full-time in-house staff details. More than two new attributes are introduced which are not covered by the existing 'Employee' schema, necessitating the creation of a new 'Contractors' schema.",
    "Updated Record of Schema": [
        {
            "Schema Name": "Employee",
            "Attributes": [
                {"employee_id": "Unique identifier for each employee."},
                {"name": "Full name of the employee."},
                {"department": "Department within the company where the employee works."},
                {"email": "Email address of the employee."}
            ]
        },
        {
            "Schema Name": "Contractors",
            "Attributes": [
                {"contractor_id": "Unique identifier for each contractor, differentiating from full-time employees."},
                {"name": "Full name of the contractor."},
                {"affiliation": "Name of the external organization or group the contractor is associated with."},
                {"project": "Specific project the contractor worked on."},
                {"email": "Email address of the contractor, used for contact and correspondence."},
                {"submission_method": "Method used by the contractor to submit work hours or documents, e.g., a specific software or online tool."}
            ]
        },
    ],
    "Assignment": "Contractors"
}
```
